This is the git repository for the validation study for classifying emotions as displayed by Cozmo that was run in fall 2019.

If you would like to run the code on a local computer, follow these instructions:

1) open this folder (containing index.php) in a terminal window
2) Enter this command: php -S localhost:8000
3) Open the address specified above in any web browser (e.g. Firefox, Google Chrome)
4) To run the experiment with a given prolific id, append "/your_id_here" to the URL

The number behind the colon is the port number. Without elevated privileges, many ports are blocked by default for security purposes. Port 8000 should work in any case.
